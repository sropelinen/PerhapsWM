# PerhapsWM

A proof of concept of a window manager with an emphasis on grouping multiple windows into one using tabs similar to ones in web browsers.
This is the first Python project I made in 2019 with the purpose of learning how to code.
Didn't bother to debug so highly likely to crash.

## Features
 - Basic WM features
    - Moving, resizing and switching between windows
    - Program executing and terminating
    - Workspaces
    - 3 layouts: tiled, stacking and maximized
    - Keyboard and mouse bindings
 - Gtk 3 window decorations with tabs
    - Tabs can be moved between windows
    - Decorations can be toggled off
    - Tabs can have colors based on program
 - Rounded corners
